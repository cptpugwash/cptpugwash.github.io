title: About me 
---

Just another generic hacking blog about things I've made notes on and made more presentable.

I am a graduate Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures masters student with more than 5 years experience as an IT engineer in various roles. Looking for a junior security role within the UK preferably.

Currently working my way through vulnerable vm's and a couple of books (Practical malware analysis and Practial reverse engineering) and moving onto the OSCP cert.

Good resources I've worked though:

  * Practical malware analysis  
  * The web application hackers handbook  
  * The hidden language of computer hardware and software / Code  
  * Hacking the art of exploitation
  * Black hat python  
  * Violent python
