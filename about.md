Just another hacking blog to contain finished posts about stuff I've been up to. Itâ€™s a bit bare at the moment as I have about 20+ markdown files with a mess of notes in them that need to be formatted.

I am a graduate Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures masters student with nearly 4 years experience as an IT engineer in various roles. Looking for a junior security role within the UK preferably.

Currently finishing off the practical malware analysis book and will sort out the mess of notes and upload at some point. Also working my way though vulnhub vms to practise for the OSCP cert.

Books I've gone through that are pretty good:

  Practical malware analysis  
  The web application hackers handbook  
  The hidden language of computer hardware and software / Code  
  Black hat python  
  Violent python
