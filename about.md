title: About me 
---

Just another generic hacking blog, just about things I've made notes on and made more presentable.

I am a graduate Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures masters student with more than 5 years experience as an IT engineer in various roles. Looking for a junior security role within the UK preferably.

Currently finishing off the practical malware analysis book and will sort out the mess of lab notes and upload at some point. Also working my way though vulnhub VMs to practise for the OSCP cert.

Good resources I've worked though:

  Practical malware analysis  
  The web application hackers handbook  
  The hidden language of computer hardware and software / Code  
  Black hat python  
  Violent python
